**SMPSEQ3--Fun-with-Sequences**
You are given a sorted sequence ofnintegersS=s1,s2, ...,snand a sorted sequence ofmintegersQ=q1,q2, ...,qm. Please, print in the ascending order all suchsithat does not belong toQ.
**Input data specification** 
In the first line you are given one integer2<=n<=100, and in the following linenintegers:
-100 <=si<= 100,si<=si+1.
In the third line you are given one integer2<=m<=100, and in the following linemintegers:
-100 <=qi<= 100,qi<=qi+1.
**Output data specification**
The sequence of requested integers separated by spaces.
ExampleInput:
5
-2 -1 0 1 4
6
-3 -2 -1 1 2 3
Output:
0 4
